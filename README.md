Romsun: Romanian text to phoneme convertor
==========================================

Back in 2009 I couldn't find any free text-to-speech library for Romanian, but I
did find that the [MBROLA speech synthesizer][1] supported reading Romanian
phonemes so I wrote this to transform Romanian text to the `.pho` files needed
by MBROLA.

It's not that good, but it's better than nothing. I used it for awesome things
like reading the instant messages I get from people (a Pidgin module), counting
sheep in Romanian so I can go to sleep faster, getting audio notifications of
when a website gets updated... I mean, really, Nobel prize material.
